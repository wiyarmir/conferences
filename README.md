# Keynotedex

## Building the project

There is a Gradle task that will produce a JAR ready to go.

```bash
$ ./gradlew stage
```

The output is in `backend/build/libs/backend-release.jar`.

## Running the project

The following environment variables are recognised:

| Name | Value |
|------|-------|
| PORT | Port where the server will run and listen to incoming connections |
| COOKIE_KEY | Key used to encrypt the cookies set |
| ENVIRONMENT | Can be either `production` or `development`. If absent, will assume `development`. |

## Development

You can run the backend development server executing:

```bash
$ ./gradlew backend:run
```

This will start serving the app in port 9090 by default. 

If you want to run the frontend development server as well, you can execute:

```bash
$ ./gradlew web:run
```

This will start the webpack development server in port 8080, and proxy all calls to files it doesn't know to port 9090.

**Warning**: The webpack development server will keep running until you execute `./gradlew web:stop`.

### Hot reloading

In backend, Ktor supports hot reloading, but since the task serving the app is kept alive, you need to execute in a separate console:

```bash
$ ./gradlew backend:classes -t
```

This will recompilate classes on file changes, and Ktor will detect it and reload them on the next request it serves.

For the frontend, it's enough to execute the original run task with `-t` flag.

```bash
$ ./gradlew web:run -t
```

## Deployment

There is a `Procfile` that will JustWork‚Ñ¢Ô∏è on Heroku or Herokuish environments (think [Dokku](https://github.com/dokku/dokku)).
